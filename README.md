# ZB4171: Characterizing Phenotypic Plasticity in Metastatic Cell Trajectories (Project Timeline)

### **Group members: Amelia, Chris, Wei Jing, Wei Lin**

## 1. What our goal is?
To characterize phenotypic plasticity by cell trajectory inferences and differential gene expression analyses on pan-cancer primary and metastatic tumors. 
By looking into various cancer datasets, we hope to identify potential genes responsible for initiating the hallmark of phenotypic plasticity in cancer so that we can suggest novel metastasis biomarkers or therapeutic targets to prevent cancer progression.

## 2. What datasets are we using?
GSE202695 - Done at home computer
GSE181919 - Using RStudio Server on EC2

## 3. What was done?
GSE202695
  - Whole dataset clustering + trajectory (+3D trajectory)
  - Per model type clustering trajectory 

GSE181919
  - Whole dataste clustering + trajectory
  - Clustering + trajectory of just CA (primary cancer) and LN (lymph node metastasis)
